360-Degree Vision;25;"You have a complete 360-degree field of vision. If you knowthe Karate skill, you can attack foes behind you at no penalty.Otherwise, treat off-hand hexes (typically left) and back hexes as-2 to hit (because of the clumsiness of the attack, not because youcan''t see the target). Note that every being with bilateral symmetry is assumed to have an off side unless the Ambidexterity advantage is bought; however, the GM can rule that certain tentacled or multi-limbed races do not have off-handhexes.You suffer no penalties when defending against attacks from the side or rear, and opponents gain no bonuses when attacking from behind.Extra eyes are merely a special effect of this advantage - you may possess it and have any number of eyes and the point cost remains the same.Special limitation: Eyestalks. Your expanded field of vision isdue to flexible eyestalks. Normally, these cannot be armored and can be targeted by any swung cutting weapon at -6. Damage over HT/3 cripples the eyestalk; on a failed HT roll, the eyestalk is severed! -20%. This limitation can also be applied to racial Peripheral Vision."
